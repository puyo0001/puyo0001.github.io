        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            Hello! My name is María José Puyol, I was born on a <em>very</em> sunny December 19<sup>th</sup>, 1984 in Santiago, Chile. I have always considered myself a curious person, since I was a child I have always been interested in learning new things, some of those interests remain to this day, drawing and astronomy, which inevitably led me to become interested in astrology.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I like to draw so much, I remember filling many notebooks during school, and my parents had to buy me new ones; luckily, they always supported me. My current goal is to continue expanding my career in illustration and complement it with web design to become a more complete professional.
